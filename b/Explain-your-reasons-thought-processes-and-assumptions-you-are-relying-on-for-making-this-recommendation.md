> Scope: rationale for the architecture and delivery plan of a **1,000,000‑CCU, multi‑region Reporting & Observability Platform on AWS**, including the assumptions, decision criteria, trade‑offs, and validation plan that led to the final recommendation.

---

## 1) What I’m Optimizing For (Decision Criteria)

- **Player-first outcomes:** dashboards that reflect reality quickly enough to reduce user-visible impact during incidents (freshness p99 ≤ 10s; incident MTTR driven down via faster detection + better diagnosis).
- **Operational simplicity at scale:** preferentially use **managed services** (AMP, AMG, OpenSearch, Kinesis) to avoid undifferentiated heavy lifting, but keep **escape hatches** (Mimir/Tempo on EKS, MSK) when knobs or tenancy require.
- **Cost predictability:** bound metric **cardinality** and enforce **downsampling/ILM/S3 lifecycle**; scale by **SLO signals** (freshness, query p95, cache hit) rather than raw utilization.
- **Security & compliance by default:** **PII‑free metrics**, **tokenized logs**, **mTLS end‑to‑end**, **KMS‑at‑rest**, **least‑privilege IAM**, **immutable signed images**, **audit logs to WORM S3**.
- **Portability without lock‑in:** PromQL compatibility and object‑store backed TSDBs (AMP or Mimir) so data + dashboards remain portable.
- **Fast rollback / deterministic rollouts:** **golden images** (prebaked AMIs/OCI), **instance‑refresh blue/green**, and **health gates** make rollbacks minutes, not hours.
- **Safety under burst:** decouple producers with **Kinesis/MSK**, add **backpressure** and **shedding order** to protect gameplay SLIs first.

---

## 2) Core Assumptions That Shape the Design

- **Load shape:** ~**1M CCU**, roughly NA/EU/APAC split; **~200 CCU/server ⇒ ~5,000 servers** fleet size (≈ 1,700 per region).
- **Emission cadence:** **10s steady**, **5s during incidents** to raise temporal resolution only when needed.
- **Metric shapes:** **counters + (exponential) histograms only**; no per-event time series. **~300 active series/server** with a strict **label allowlist** `{region, az, cluster, shard_id, instance_type, build_id, queue, asn_bucket}` to keep PII & high-cardinality out.
- **Throughput math (baseline):** 5,000 × (300 ÷ 10s) ≈ **150k samples/s (global)**; size for **≥200k/s** headroom, ≈ **50k/s per region**.
- **Storage sizing (order-of-magnitude):** **15–20 B/sample** amortized ⇒ ≈ **200–260 GB/day global (hot)**; budget **~500 GB/day/region hot** including index/replica overhead.
- **SLOs:** **Freshness p99 ≤ 10s**, **Query p95 ≤ 2s (≤12h), p99 ≤ 10s (7–30d)**, **Ingest TTFB p99 ≤ 250–350ms** @ 1×–3×.

> These are explicit, testable, and feed directly into capacity tests, autoscaling signals, and cost envelopes.

## 3) Why These Technologies (Reasoning Chain)

### 3.1 Metrics Plane (AMP or Mimir on S3)
- **Why PromQL/Prometheus‑compatible:** ubiquity, mature ecosystem, natural fit for **bounded‑cardinality fleet metrics**; teams already speak PromQL.
- **Why object‑store backed:** separates compute and storage → **cheap long‑term retention**, resilient to node loss, better economics for “lots of bytes, bursty queries”.
- **AMP (managed) first:** removes cluster ops, auto‑scales ingest/query; I retain **Mimir on EKS** as an **escape hatch** when stricter multi‑tenancy controls or custom knobs are needed.

### 3.2 Transport (Kinesis / MSK)
- **Why a buffer:** protects stores from producer bursts; supports **replay**, **fan‑out** (archives, analytics), and **ordered backpressure**.
- **Kinesis** is operationally simpler; **MSK** is selected only if Kafka semantics/connectors are required.

### 3.3 Logs (OpenSearch + S3/Glue/Athena)
- **Why separate from metrics:** logs carry PII risk and high cardinality; keep **metrics PII‑free** and push logs to **OpenSearch (hot 3–7d)** + **S3 (warm/cold)**.
- **ILM & UltraWarm/Cold:** reduce hot footprint; **Athena** over S3 supports cheap, long‑range investigations.

### 3.4 Visualization & Alerts (AMG + CloudWatch)
- **AMG** gives consistent RBAC/SSO and managed alerting; can query AMP, OpenSearch, and Athena in one place.
- **CloudWatch Alarms** augment Grafana with **burn‑rate** and **platform SLO** alarms routed to PagerDuty/Slack.

### 3.5 Edge & Gateways (ADOT, Fluent Bit, WireGuard)
- **ADOT agent** for batching/retry/TLS and **remote_write**; **Fluent Bit** for low‑overhead log shipping.
- **WireGuard overlay** provides consistent, private edge→gateway paths across heterogeneous environments.
- **Gateway mode (ADOT/remote_write)** centralizes **quotas, relabeling, and rate control**.

### 3.6 Golden Images & Firecracker (Ops determinism)
- **Golden AMIs/OCI** with SBOM + signature → **no drift**, **fast boot**, **fast rollback** by image ID; **cloud‑init** for last‑mile only.
- **Firecracker microVM sidecar** isolates “noisy” telemetry agents on hot hosts, preserving game CPU headroom; shares the same image pipeline.
- These choices **directly reduce MTTR** (fast, deterministic rollouts) and align with **“cattle, not pets”**.

### 3.7 Security, Identity & Governance
- **mTLS everywhere** (SPIFFE/SPIRE optional) + **KMS at rest**, **least‑privilege IAM**, **WAF/Shield** on any public UIs.
- **CloudTrail → S3 Object‑Lock**, **Config/Security Hub** for continuous assurance; **SSM Session Manager** for SSH‑less access.
- **Tag policies** and **mandatory tags** enable cost allocation and policy enforcement at scale.

## 4) Thought Process (How I NarroId Options)

1. **Characterize load** from CCU → servers → time series → ingest/storage/query. Quantitative **EPS and bytes/day** drive the rest.
2. **Constrain cardinality** at the **edge by schema** to avoid runaway cost/perf later. This is the single most important control.
3. **Prefer managed** for the data planes (**AMP/AMG/OpenSearch/Kinesis**) to compress time‑to‑value and reduce toil.
4. **Insert a durable buffer** (Kinesis/MSK) so producers never couple directly to stores; bursts become a queueing problem I can reason about.
5. **SLOs as control signals:** autoscale and admit/deny based on **freshness, query p95, cache hit** — not CPU.
6. **Design for rollback first:** golden images + instance refresh + health gates; **rollbacks in minutes**.
7. **Keep portability:** PromQL + object store + IaC. If managed limits bite, swap to **Mimir on EKS** with minimal user‑facing change.
8. **Encode safety rails:** quotas, 429/Retry‑After, label allowlist, CI lints, and explicit “kill switches” for bad metrics.

---

## 5) Trade‑offs & Why I’m Comfortable With Them

- **AMP vs. Mimir:** AMP loIrs ops overhead; Mimir gives deeper tenancy/knobs. I **start with AMP**, hold **Mimir as plan‑B** (IaC patterns make migration tractable).
- **Kinesis vs. MSK:** Kinesis is simpler; MSK is heavier but feature‑rich. I pick **Kinesis** unless Kafka semantics are required.
- **eBPF/Cilium now vs. later:** poIrful but adds operational complexity. I **defer deep kernel instrumentation** to a later milestone; keep **summaries** under ≤3% CPU now.
- **More downsampling vs. fidelity:** I **prefer edge histograms** (accurate p95/p99) over raw events to contain cost.
- **OpenSearch hot retention:** keep **3–7d** hot and push the rest to S3/UltraWarm to balance searchability vs. cost.

---

## 6) Risks & How I Mitigate Them

- **Cardinality creep →** strict schema + CI lints + per‑tenant series/sample limits + runtime reject + “kill switch.”
- **Query hotspots →** recording rules, query sharding, result caching, and dashboard budgets.
- **Compactor/store‑gateway lag →** compaction backlog SLOs, bucket‑index health, and scaling policies.
- **Burst storms →** streaming buffer + shedding order (verbose logs first) + backpressure + replay drills.
- **Cost drift →** daily bytes‑added by tier, object‑store ops/query alarms, cache hit SLO, ILM/S3 lifecycle.
- **Security drift →** Config/Hub controls, CloudTrail with S3 Object‑Lock, periodic access review, key/cert rotation SLOs.

---

## 7) Why This Meets the SLO & Security Requirements

- **SLOs:** Freshness p99 ≤ 10s is enforced from agent → buffer → store, measured as **write→read age** and tied to autoscaling; **Query p95 ≤ 2s** is achieved via **recording rules + cache** and query budgets.
- **Security:** **end‑to‑end encryption** (TLS/mTLS), **KMS at rest**, **SSM w/ SSH disabled**, **private VPC endpoints**, **WAF/Shield** for any public UI, and **immutable, signed images** satisfying change integrity.
- **MTTR objective (aggressive):** golden images + instance refresh + fast health gates + optional Firecracker isolation shorten deploy/rollback cycles and reduce blast radius.

---

## 8) Validation Plan (How I Prove It, Not Just Believe It)

- **T0–T8 test matrix** (env parity, ingest soak ≥1.3×, bursts 1×/3×/5×, query load, AZ/broker chaos, replay, completeness, cardinality guard, cost/SLO scaling).
- **Realistic data shape** in load gen (labels + exponential histograms).
- **User‑boundary oracles:** **write→read age histogram**, **ingest TTFB**, **query duration** SLOs, **cache hit**, **object‑store ops/query**, and **producer sent vs indexed**.
- **Pass/fail gates to ship:** T1, T3, T4, T5 are hard gates; others are fix‑forward with mitigations documented.

---

## 9) On Golden Images & Firecracker (Why They Matter Here)

- **Golden images** (with exporters/ADOT/Fluent Bit baked, hardening, SBOM, signatures) make boots **deterministic** and **fast**, remove “works‑on‑my‑box” config drift, and give **image‑ID rollbacks**.
- **Firecracker microVM sidecars** provide **VM‑grade isolation** for telemetry agents on hot hosts with near‑container footprint; this keeps **game CPU headroom** predictable and **reduces noise/blast radius**.
- Both are aligned with “**cattle, not pets**” and are pivotal to achieving **high availability** targets.

---

## 10) Why This Is Sensible For 1M‑CCU Scale

- The design directly reflects the **math of the load** (EPS, bytes/day), confines cardinality at the **edge**, and turns risk into **explicit SLOs** that drive scaling and cost.
- It keeps operators effective under stress: **snappy dashboards**, **clear freshness** signal, **standard triage** (Golden Signals), and **recording rules** for fast reads.
- It remains **portable** and **auditable**: PromQL, object‑store blocks, IaC, signed images, and WORM audit trails.

---

## 11) Sources I Leaned On (At a High Level)

- **AWS** official docs & reference architectures for AMP/AMG, OpenSearch, Kinesis/Firehose, VPC endpoints, KMS/IAM/SSM/Shield/WAF, S3 lifecycle.
- **Prometheus/Grafana** guidance on histograms, naming & cardinality, recording rules, Mimir architecture.
- **Google SRE** books & workbook (Golden Signals, managing load/overload, monitoring distributed systems).
- **Brendan Gregg** (USE method; Systems Performance 2e) for resource analysis, multi‑tenant controls, and kernel networking insights.
- **Internal security baselines** (SOC2/ISO 27001 aligned), and our **Design‑Notes.md** link pack.

> These are not copied verbatim; they served as **principled guardrails** to shape a design that is testable, operable, and secure.

---

## 12) What Would Change My Mind (Assumptions to Revisit)

- **Different load shape:** materially higher series/server or incident cadence → revisit EPS/cost math and the streaming tier.
- **Strict residency/BYOK per tenant:** favor Mimir on EKS with **per‑tenant KMS keys** and stricter isolation.
- **Heavier tracing/APM needs:** consider managed APM or Tempo at day‑1; revisit cost of trace storage.
- **Cross‑cloud portability mandate:** invest in **Mimir + Tempo** and multi‑cloud object‑stores; reduce reliance on managed regional services.
- **PII in metrics** (should not happen): immediate schema change + re‑tokenize at edge + purge pipeline with audit proof.

---

## 13) TL;DR

I chose a **PromQL‑compatible, object‑store‑backed, SLO‑driven, managed‑first** stack with **edge‑bounded cardinality**, **durable buffering**, **golden images**, and optional **Firecracker isolation**. The choices map directly to the quantified load and are **validated by an explicit T0–T8 test plan**. Security and cost controls are baked in from the start, and portability is preserved via open formats and IaC.
