- **cosign/sigstore (image signing & attestations)** — Supply-chain integrity for AMIs/OCI; only trusted images run.
- **SBOM tooling (Syft/Grype)** — Software bill of materials and vuln scan; visibility and compliance for baked artifacts.
- **IMDSv2-only + SSH disabled (SSM only)** — Strong instance identity and no open SSH; reduces lateral movement and key sprawl.
- **WireGuard (overlay) on edge/gateway hosts** — Lightweight encrypted mesh for agents→gateways; simple keys and high performance.
- **Prometheus Node Exporter (host metrics)** — Standard host telemetry; baseline signals for capacity/SLOs across fleets.
- **Custom Gameplay Exporter (game SLIs)** — Player-centric counters/histograms (tick, action→ack); what matters to incidents.
- **AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry — ADOT (agent mode)** — On-host collector for batching/retry/TLS; efficient remote_write to gateways.
- **Fluent Bit (logs)** — Low-overhead log forwarder to Firehose/OpenSearch/S3; edge tokenization/redaction.
- **AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry — ADOT (gateway mode) / Prometheus remote_write gateway** — Central throttle/relabel/quotas; isolates AMP from bursty edges.
- **Envoy or Nginx (TLS, auth, 429/Retry-After)** — Front door for gateways; enforces mTLS, rate limits, and graceful backpressure.
- **Elastic Load Balancing (ALB/NLB as needed)** — HA entry points for UIs (ALB) and TCP collectors (NLB); simplifies failover.
- **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (buffer/decoupler)** — Durable, scalable queue for metrics/logs; absorbs spikes and enables replay/fan-out.
- **Amazon Kinesis Firehose (logs→OpenSearch & S3)** — Managed delivery with batching/compression; cheap, reliable log pipelines.
- **Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) (metrics hot store)** — Managed PromQL TSDB; offloads scaling/ops for 10s hot retention.
- **Grafana Mimir on EKS (optional alternative to AMP; S3-backed)** — Self-managed PromQL at massive scale with tighter multi-tenancy controls.
- **Amazon OpenSearch Service (logs hot + UltraWarm/Cold)** — Searchable logs with ILM tiers; quick investigations plus low-cost retention.
- **Amazon S3 (warm/cold metrics & logs; Parquet/ORC archives)** — Durable, cheap object store; powers long-range analytics and backups.
- **AWS Glue (catalog) + Glue ETL / AWS Lambda (downsampling jobs)** — Schema/catalog and ETL to Parquet; enables Athena-friendly rollups.
- **Amazon Athena (SQL on S3, long-range analytics)** — Serverless queries over S3 archives; ad-hoc analysis without clusters.
- **Amazon Managed Grafana (AMG) (dashboards & alerts)** — Central visualization with SSO/RBAC; unified views across AMP/OS/Athena.
- **Amazon CloudWatch Alarms (SLO, freshness, cache, object-store ops)** — Native alerting on platform health KPIs; ties autoscale to outcomes.
- **PagerDuty / Slack / AWS Chatbot (incident routing)** — Fast human loop closure; pages the right team with context.
- **AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) (chaos testing)** — Safe, controlled failures (AZ/broker/ingester); proves resilience gates.
- **Terraform (IaC) / AWS CDK (optional)** — Repeatable provisioning and drift detection; infra as reviewed code.

- **Amazon Service Quotas (tracking & alarms)** — Monitors capacity limits (e.g., Kinesis shards); avoids hidden scaling caps.
- **Amazon Macie (sensitive data detection on S3 archives)** — ML-backed PII discovery; validates that archives remain compliant.
